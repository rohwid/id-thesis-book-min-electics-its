	The games with the Role-Playing Game (RPG) genre was a competitive game, between players against other players or enemies with the form of Non-Player Character (NPC). Many game developers when makes the game itself still uses manual approach when determining the stats or gameplay attribute for the player or enemy character. When in a game has a lot of characters, such as a game with many player characters (JRPG and TRPG) and the game usually have a lot of enemies. In this research, several approaches such as $k-$NN, Normal Distribution and Naive Bayes. They were implemented to calculate the stats and level growth for player and enemy characters automatically. Then, the Neural Network Multiclass Classification was used for classifying the stats that was generated before. It aims to calculate the suitability of the player's and enemy's character stats that was created before.
