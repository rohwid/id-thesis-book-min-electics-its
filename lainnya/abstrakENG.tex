	Action or turn-based RPG (Role Playing Game) games are competitive games, between players against players or against enemies in the form of non-player characters (NPC). Many game developers in making the game itself still use manual methods in determining statistical data from the character of the player or enemy. If in a game has a lot of characters, such as only many player characters (for example in turn-based RPGs) and many enemies. In this research, several approaches such as $k-$NN (Nearest Neighbor), $k-$Means, Normal Distribution, and Naive Bayes will be implemented which will be used to help in producing statistical data on characters and enemies automatically.
