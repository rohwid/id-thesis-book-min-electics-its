	The game with the Role Playing Game (RPG) genre was a competitive game, between players against other players or against enemies with form of Non-Player Character (NPC). Many game developers when makes the game itself still uses manual approach when determine the statistical data for the player or enemy character. When in a game has a lot of characters, such as only a lot of player characters (for example on JRPG and TRPG) and many enemies. In this research several approaches such as $k-$NN (Nearest Neighbor) was implemented, Normal Distribution and Naive Bayes which used to generate statistical data for player characters and enemy automatically. Then, the Neural Network Multiclass Classification will be used for validate the stats that was generated before.
